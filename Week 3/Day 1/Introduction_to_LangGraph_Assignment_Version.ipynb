We can set it to `auto` and let the model choose, in which case there is a native prompt that accesses each tool's description attribute, which provides guidance on when to use the tool (example tool descriptions in cells above)."

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

The best model family, Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT with only 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across multiple datasets and model types.\\n\\n### Latest Tweets of Authors\\n\\n1. **Tim Dettmers**\\n   - **Latest Tweet:** Tim Dettmers is joining Ai2 as an AI researcher.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, conversational agents, and other applications requiring access to a large knowledge base.'"

The reflection agent\\'s role is to observe the outcomes of each operation and handle any mistakes accordingly. This helps in correcting erroneous operations and improving the overall task completion rate.\\n\\nThe reflection agent works alongside a planning agent and a decision agent.

Here are some key insights from recent research on this topic:\\n\\n1. **EvoAgent**:\\n   - **Authors**: Siyu Yuan, Kaitao Song, Jiangjie Chen, Xu Tan, Dongsheng Li, Deqing Yang\\n   - **Summary**: EvoAgent is a method that uses evolutionary algorithms to automatically extend single-agent systems into multi-agent systems. This approach enhances the task-solving capabilities of LLM-based agents by generating multiple agents with diverse settings. The process involves evolutionary operators like mutation, crossover, and selection to create a variety of agents, improving the overall effectiveness without additional human design.\\n\\n2. **Self-Organized Agents (SoA)**:\\n   - **Authors**: Yoichi Ishibashi, Yoshimasa Nishimura\\n   - **Summary**: SoA is a multi-agent framework designed for ultra-large-scale code generation and optimization. It addresses the limitations of single-agent systems in handling large and complex codebases by enabling scalable and efficient code generation. In this framework, self-organized agents independently generate and modify code components while collaborating to build the overall codebase. The system dynamically scales by multiplying agents based on problem complexity, allowing for indefinite increases in code volume while maintaining manageable code sizes for each agent. SoA has shown to outperform single-agent systems in terms of code generation accuracy.\\n\\nThese frameworks highlight the potential of multi-agent systems in enhancing the capabilities of LLM-based agents, particularly in complex and large-scale tasks.',\n",
