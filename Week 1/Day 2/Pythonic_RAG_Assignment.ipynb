Since the sub-classifiers share a common backbone of upstream weights, at inference time the trained model is able to interpolate feature values not explicitly specified at training time, allowing for increased flexibility.\n",

A simple implementation of this\\napproach leads to 128×theoretical (in terms of FLOPS) and 14×wall-clock time speedups compared\\nto a single-shot retrieval system that uses a standard embedding vector; note that MRL ’s retrieval\\naccuracy is comparable to that of single-shot retrieval (Section 4.3.1). Finally, as MRL explicitly\\nlearns coarse-to-fine representation vectors, intuitively it should share more semantic information\\namong its various dimensions (Figure 5). This is reflected in up to 2%accuracy gains in long-tail\\ncontinual learning settings while being as robust as the original embeddings. Furthermore, due to its\\ncoarse-to-fine grained nature, MRL can also be used as method to analyze hardness of classification\\namong instances and information bottlenecks.\\nWe make the following key contributions:\\n1.We introduce\\n',\n",

The deployment of deep representations has two steps:\\n(1) an expensive yet constant-cost forward pass to compute the representation [ 29] and (2) utilization\\nof the representation for downstream applications [ 50,89].

Our main contribution is\\nMatryoshka Representation Learning (MRL ) which encodes information at\\ndifferent granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt to the computational\\nconstraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies existing representation\\nlearning pipelines and imposes no additional cost during inference and deployment.\\nMRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that are at least as accurate and rich as\\nindependently trained low-dimensional representations. The flexibility within the\\nlearned Matryoshka Representations offer: (a) up to 14×smaller embedding\\nsize for ImageNet-1K classification at the same level of accuracy; (b) up to 14×\\nreal-world speed-ups for large-scale retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up\\nto2% accuracy improvements for long-tail few-shot classification, all while being\\nas robust as the original representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seam-\\nlessly to web-scale ',\n",

        "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
        "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",

            "The best way to write a loop in Python largely depends on your specific use case, but here are a few good practices to keep in mind:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Choose the Right Type of Loop:**\n",
            "   - **`for` Loop:** Best used when iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).\n",
            "   - **`while` Loop:** Suitable when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and you want to continue until a certain condition is met.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**\n",
            "   This can help make your code more readable. Instead of using generic names like `i`, try naming your loop variable something that describes its purpose.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Keep Code Inside Loops Readable and Concise:**\n",
            "   Avoid putting too much logic inside a loop. If your loop body is complex, consider refactoring that code into a separate function.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Avoid Modifying a List While Iterating:**\n",
            "   If you need to modify a collection, it’s often safer to create a new list or to collect changes and apply them after your loop finishes.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Utilize `enumerate()` for Index Tracking:**\n",
            "   When you need both the index and the value during an iteration, using `enumerate()` can improve clarity:\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   for index, value in enumerate(my_list):\n",
            "       print(index, value)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Incorporate Breaks and Continues Judiciously:**\n",
            "   Use `break` to exit a loop early and `continue` to skip to the next iteration when required, but avoid overusing these as they can make your code harder to follow.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Consider Using List Comprehensions:**\n",
            "   For simple loops that build lists, a list comprehension can be more concise and expressive:\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "Here’s a simple example of a well-structured `for` loop:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Print squares of even numbers from 1 to 10\n",
            "for number in range(1, 11):\n",
            "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
            "        square = number ** 2\n",
            "        print(f\"The square of {number} is {square}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "And a `while` loop example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Sum numbers until a sentinel value (0) is entered\n",
            "total = 0\n",
            "while True:\n",
            "    number = int(input(\"Enter a number (0 to stop): \"))\n",
            "    if number == 0:\n",
            "        break\n",
            "    total += number\n",
            "print(f\"The total is {total}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your loops are effective, readable, and maintainable! If you have a specific case in mind, feel free to share, and I’d be happy to help with more targeted advice.\n"
